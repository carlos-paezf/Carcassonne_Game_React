# Game: Carcassonne

## Introduction

I decided to develop the Carcassonne Game with the REACT library in the TypeScript template in order to simplify the creation process and improve interaction with the graphics components. Initially, I attempted to develop the idea using Vanilla TS and implementing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). However, I eventually decided to the transition to REACT with functional components, while still using some classes to generate instances and render them in the interface.

Throughout the development process, I focused on building the project from the ground up, while also incorporating key REACT concepts such as state, API context, reducer and hooks. These tools allowed me to globally connect application logic and stay up-to-date with changes in the game.
